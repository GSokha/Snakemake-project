# Snakemake-project

  A project in transcriptomics. 
  
  The workflow runs with the command "snakemake --core 1"
  
  Final output files are collibri_counts.txt and kappa_counts.txt in the main folder.
  
  External scripts utilize absolute path for the input files, so it needs to be changed to be run on another system.
